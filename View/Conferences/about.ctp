<h1><?php echo $view_title; ?></h1>

<p>MathMeetings.net provides a list of conferences and similar
meetings in mathematics.  There are a number of other such lists, but
this list aims to be more complete by allowing <em>anyone at all</em>
to add announcements.  This is similar in spirit to a wiki, but the
announcements are formatted and stored in a database for efficient
searching and sorting.</p>

<p>Announcements are filtered by subject tags, and are curated by <a
href=#curators>the volunteers listed below</a>.  <em>Note</em>: This site
restricts itself to meetings whose focus is mathematics.  Announcements
about more general meetings are typically not appropriate and may be
deleted.</p>

<p>The site is developed by <a href="http://nilesjohnson.net"
target="blank">Niles Johnson</a>.  It began as a list for conferences
in topology, but with the addition of subject tags we hope that it
will be useful more generally.  Please <a
href="http://nilesjohnson.net/contact.html" target="blank">contact
Niles</a> if you have further quesitons or comments!</p>


<h2>Adding Announcements</h2>
<div>
<p>
To add an announcement, use the link at the top of the page.  An email
address is required so that announcements you post can be edited or
deleted.  To prevent spam, some simple arithmetic is also required.
In addition, a security token is stored as a browser cookie.
</p>

<p>
When you add an announcement, you will receive a message like the following:
</p>

<div id="add-message">

<pre>Thanks for adding your announcement to MathMeetings.net.
The announcement data is copied below, and is also available at:
http://mathmeetings.net/conferences/view/28

If you need to edit or delete your announcement, use the unique edit/delete link:
http://mathmeetings.net/conferences/edit/28/YSZf1X2W

If you have any difficulties, questions, or comments, don't hesitate
to contact the curators:

</div>

<p>
If you need to update your announcement, use the links provided to access the edit or delete pages.  Each announcement is assigned a random string which is required to edit or delete; this appears at the end of the links above and is re-generated each time the announcement is updated.
</p>
</div>


<h2 class="target" id="tags_about">Subject Tags</h2>
<div>

<p>With subject tags, we can include announcements from a broader
range of fields while still allowing users to focus the conferences
relevant for their field.  When the tagging feature was first
implemented, all announcements were tagged as 'at.algebraic-topology'.
Future announcements are assigned a subject upon entry into the
database.  The subject tags are taken from the <a
href="http://arxiv.org/archive/math">arXiv.org math
categories</a>.</p>

<p>The link to update tags on the home page is generated automatically by 
javascript.  If you prefer not to use javascript, you can easily create the 
appropriate URL by hand.  Simply use the 2-letter codes for each subject, 
separated by dashes.  For example, to choose 
<span class="tag">at.algebraic-topology</span> and 
<span class="tag">ct.category-theory</span>, use the following URL:</p>
<pre>
https://mathmeetings.net/at-ct
</pre>

<p>Note: Multiple tags are combined with an OR condition, meaning that
you will see announcements which are tagged with any of the tags you
select.  For now, it does not seem useful to introduce more complex
search logic.</p>

<p>Subject tags are supported on the main list, the rss feed, and the
new announcement form.  On the form, any active subject tags are used
to set the default tags for the new announcement.</p>

</div>

<h2 class="target" id="rss_about">RSS Feed</h2>
<div>

<p> An RSS feed is an electronic format for publishing information
that is frequently updated.  Using a feed reader, one can quickly scan
the list of topics.  New topics which have not yet been viewed are
highlighted for convenience.  One can also parse the rss feed with
external software to develop an alternative front end for the
list.</p>

<p>The <a
href="https://mathmeetings.net/conferences/index.rss">RSS
feed for this site</a> gives a list of conference titles, sorted by
date, and direct links to their homepages.  You can also get an RSS feed 
for your subject(s) of choice by appending '.rss' after your tag names.  For example
<?php echo $this->Html->link(
  'at-gt.rss', array('controller'=>null, 'action'=>'at-gt.rss'));?> 
 or
<?php echo $this->Html->link(
  'ag-nt.rss', array('controller'=>null, 'action'=>'ag-nt.rss'));?>.
</p>
<p>
You can read more about
RSS feeds at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS"
target="blank">Wikipedia page</a>.  One example of a feed reader is <a
href="http://www.feedly.com" target="blank">Feedly</a>.  There are <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=rss+aggregator" target="blank">many
others</a>. </p>

<p>New in version 2.1.3: calendar event links are now included with
the 'enclosure' tag.</p>

</div>


<h2 class="target" id="xml_json_about">JSON and XML interfaces</h2>
<div>

<p>JSON and XML are two structured data formats which can be easily
parsed by third-party software.  Access the interfaces similarly to the RSS feed:
use the extension '.json' or '.xml' after your subject tags.  For example:
<?php echo $this->Html->link(
  'at-gt.json', array('controller'=>null, 'action'=>'at-gt.json'));?> 
 or
<?php echo $this->Html->link(
  'ag-nt.xml', array('controller'=>null, 'action'=>'ag-nt.xml'));?>.
</p>
<p>
You can use these, for instance, to
set up an alternate front for the announements on this site.  A crude
demo can be found <a
href="https://nilesjohnson.net/mathmeetings-front.html">here</a>.
Contact Niles if you are interested in additional features.</p>

</div>



<h2 class="target" id="cal_about">Calendar Links</h2>
<div>

<p> Links are provided to automatically import data from each
conference announcement into <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendaring_software">calendaring
software</a>.  We have a direct link for Google Calendar, and an <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar">iCalendar (.ics)</a>
formatted file for importing into other software.</p>

<p>New in version 2.1.3: An ICS feed is available, giving calendar
events for all announcements matching the given tag string.  A link to
the ICS feed is printed on the main index page, next to the RSS link.
</p>

</div>

<h2 class="target" id="curators">Curators</h2>
<div>

<p> The people listed here have volunteered to help curate this site.
They help keep the list up-to-date by adding new announcements, if the
organizers haven't done so themselves.  They receive a copy of the
edit/delete keys for each announcement, and can help if you have any
trouble posting or updating your announcements.  </p>

<p>If you would like to volunteer, please <a
href="http://nilesjohnson.net/contact.html" target="blank">let Niles
know</a>!</p>

<h2>Searching</h2>
<div>
<p>
A very rudimentary search form is now available at <?php echo $this->Html->link(
  'conferences/search', array('controller'=>'conferences', 'action'=>'search'));?>.
You can also set the tags by default with an extra parameter such as <?php echo $this->Html->link(
  'conferences/search/at-gt', array('controller'=>'conferences', 'action'=>'search/at-gt'));?>.
</p>

<p>Currently the search only performs simple date comparison and basic
string matching in certain fields.  As time permits, we will work on a
more flexible and full-featured search.  Please <a
href="http://nilesjohnson.net/contact.html" target="blank">let Niles
know</a> if you have any specific fuctionality requests!</p>

</div>

<h2>Countries List</h2>
<div>
<p>The list of countries provided when adding new announcements is from the <?php echo $this->Html->link('World countries','https://github.com/mledoze/countries');?> database, licensed under the <?php echo $this->Html->link('Open Database License 1.0','http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1.0/')?>.
</p>
</div>

<h2>Tracking</h2>
<div>
<p>
We use Google Analytics for tracking visitors.  This provides a wealth
of useful information about how the site is used, and helps us make
decisions about how to improve functionality.  There are a variety of
options for <a
href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=google+analytics+disable+tracking"
target="blank">disabling Google Analytics</a>.
</p>

<p>External libraries typically also implement their own tracking.  On
this site, we use some components of the Jquery javascript library and
various social networking buttons on the announcement view pages.</p>

</div>

<h2>Browser Cookies</h2>
<div>

<p> The code from external libraries typically makes use of browser
cookies.  This includes cookies from <tt>google.com</tt>,
<tt>jquery.com</tt>, and <tt>twitter.com</tt>.  These are neither
owned nor set directly by this site, and to our knowledge none of this
site's functionality depends in a critical way on these cookies.<p>

<p>This site does set a browser cookie to store a security key called
a CSRF token.  This is used for processing the New Announcement form
and ensures that malicious users cannot repeatedly submit
announcements using the same successful captcha.  The cookie contains
no user information and is immediately discarded upon use.</p>
